- **IDE:** Google Colaboratory
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Project Structure

### 1. Introduction
Provides an overview of the project, including objectives and significance.

### 2. Data Preparation and Cleaning
- Loaded the dataset
- Handled missing values
- Ensured data types were correct for further analysis

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted descriptive statistics
- Created visualizations to explore data distributions and correlations

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Created new features like `MntTotal` and `NumTotalPurchases` to enhance the analysis

### 5. K-Means Clustering
- Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups

### 6. Standardizing Data
- Standardized the data to ensure equal contribution of each feature to the analysis

### 7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Used PCA to reduce data dimensionality and visualize the clusters

### 8. Determining Optimal Number of Clusters
- Used the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to identify the optimal number of clusters

### 9. Cluster Visualization
- Provided visual representations of the clusters

### 10. Cluster Characteristics
- Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster, including demographics and purchasing patterns

### 11. Results
Summarizes the findings from the clustering analysis and their implications for business strategy.

### 12. Conclusion
Concludes the analysis with key takeaways, potential actions based on the customer segments, and areas for further research.

## Key Findings

- Identified distinct customer segments with varying purchasing behaviors and demographics.
- Provided insights to help tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
