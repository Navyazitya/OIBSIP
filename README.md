## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

### Introduction

This project is part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset. The aim was to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help retail businesses make informed decisions.

### Project Overview

- Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data
- Dataset: [Retail Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset)
- IDE: Google Colab

### Project Steps and Insights

1. Data Loading and Cleaning
   - Loaded the dataset into Google Colab.
   - Cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy and completeness for analysis.

2. Descriptive Statistics
   - Calculated basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand the data distribution.

3. Time Series Analysis
   - Analyzed sales trends over time.
   - Identified seasonal patterns and performed moving average analysis.

4. Customer Insights
   - Examined customer demographics, including gender and age distribution.
   - Segmented customers based on purchasing behavior.

5. Product Analysis
   - Analyzed total sales by product category.
   - Investigated price distribution and conducted price elasticity analysis.

6. Bivariate Analysis
   - Explored relationships between different variables using advanced visualizations, including hexbin plots and heatmaps.

7. Correlations
   - Created a correlation matrix to identify significant relationships between variables.

8. Cumulative Sales
   - Analyzed cumulative sales over time, highlighting consistent growth.

### Key Findings

- Sales Trend: Significant fluctuations over time.
- Transaction Frequency: Highest in May.
- Product Categories: Electronics and clothing were the highest-selling.
- Customer Demographics: Balanced gender distribution with a majority of female customers; common age group around 40 years.
- Purchasing Behavior: Most purchases in the $0-$250 range with a group of high spenders.
- Seasonal Patterns: January had the highest sales with spikes in February, March, July, and August.
- Correlations: Strong correlation between quantity purchased and total amount spent.

### Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into retail sales data, helping businesses optimize strategies and drive growth.
